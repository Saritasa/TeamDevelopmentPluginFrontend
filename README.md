This plugin is created to help developers team to detect his work intersection.

Right now it allows only to check does current file edited by some other 
developer or not by clicking on popup menu item in editor. In future this action
will be triggered automatically when file editing will be started. Possibly 
feature to view remote developer version of the file will be available too.

You can use **IntelliJ IDEA Community edition** for development. 
It requires **JDK 1.8**, **not greater**.

Plugin can be used on any JetBrains IDE
